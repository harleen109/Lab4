This program allows a user three tries to guess the correct answer to the question

question = "What is the captial of California". The answer is "Sacramento"


We first set max_tries = 3. then we create a loop to iterate three times. for each iteration,
we ask the user for an answer (user input). Then based on the answer the user gives, we check 
to see if the user input matches the correct answer. If so, print "correct", then the loop will be terminated with a break statement.

if the user gives the wrong answer more than 3 times, 
then print "you have used up your allotted guesses", then print the 'correct answer is California'
